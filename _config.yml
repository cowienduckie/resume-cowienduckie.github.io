  Hi,  I am Minh Tran, a software development intern. I have 6 months of experience in <mark>.NET core</mark> technologies and good knowledge of Database Design, Object-Oriented Analysis and Design.  
  Learning new stuff is my strength. Currently, I am trying my best to learn JavaScript, ReactJS, other front-end technologies in general, and especially ASP .NET Core Web API. 
  In my university classes, I am considered a good team player because I usually match up with classmates that I haven't worked with before instead of my friends. In my opinion, these are always good experiences so that I can improve my communication skill, learn new languages and technologies from new teammates.
  My favorite books are <mark>Algorithm</mark> (Jeff Erickson), <mark>Head First Design Patterns</mark>.

          Having an internship at Viettel IDC, which is the leading provider of data center and cloud computing services in Vietnam, is a good experience for myself. When working here, I can learn a lot of communication and technical skills, especially <mark>.NET development</mark> and how an <mark>Agile</mark> team really works.
